# Adapter for CLAUDE.md

PRIME-BLOCK-BEGIN
This repository is governed by a 6LAYER blueprint pack. AGENTS.md is the authoritative control plane; if anything here conflicts with AGENTS.md, AGENTS.md wins.
On every session start, execute THE BOOT SEQUENCE:
1. Read AGENTS.md fully. 2. Read COMMANDS.md. 3. Read .agent/GRAPH.md and .agent/LOOPS.md. 4. Run: sh scripts/ledger.sh tail 30. 5. Run sh scripts/preflight.sh -- it MUST print "preflight: ok"; if it fails, report the exact missing items from PREFLIGHT.md and stop (this is the only legitimate pre-run stop). 6. Run sh scripts/graph-next.sh and dispatch on its one-line output exactly as .agent/GRAPH.md specifies. 7. Repeat step 6 after every completed node until ALL_DONE, then run the ship gate in AGENTS.md.
Hard rules: do not ask the user questions; choose the smallest reversible option, record it, continue. Use only commands from COMMANDS.md. Never invent an API, route, table, flag, or env var. One node at a time; commit after every milestone; append ledger events. Never weaken a gate, skip a required test, or claim an unrun result. Production construction is not authorized in FORGE_ONLY mode.

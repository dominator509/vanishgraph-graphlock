# EP-003

Purpose: execute only this graph node. Non-goals: no unrelated refactor, no fake success, no deployment. Read AGENTS.md, COMMANDS.md, graph, loops, linked specs and ledger. Define acceptance tests before production paths. Run exact commands, capture sentinels, append ledger, commit, and resume from first unchecked milestone.
